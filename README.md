# Power-BI-Data-Engineering-and-Visualization-Project

This repository contains the implementation for **Milestone 2** of the "Data Engineering and Visualization" course for the Winter Semester 2024 at the German International University. The project focuses on creating interactive and insightful dashboards using **Power BI**. In this milestone, we integrated, cleaned, and transformed datasets related to the **Paris 2024 Olympic Games**, visualizing various metrics like medal distribution, athlete participation, and more.

## Project Overview

In this milestone, we performed the following tasks:
- **Data Integration**: Integrated datasets from the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games, resulting in a new consolidated dataset.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Addressed incorrect data types, missing values, and performed feature engineering.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Built two pages of interactive dashboards in Power BI. One page focused on the integrated dataset, while the other explored other relevant datasets.
  
The dashboards are designed to provide insights into the Olympic Games, with a focus on medal distribution, athlete participation, performance by country, and gender comparisons.

### Key Features:
1. **Two Pages of Dashboards**:
   - Integrated datasets and visualizations on one page.
   - Separate visualizations on the second page using other datasets.
   
2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Slicers** to filter data by country, gender, and other categories.
   - **DAX Measures** to dynamically calculate values like total medals, average BMI, and more.

3. **Research Questions**:
   - **Venue Analysis**: Which venues hosted the highest number of events?
   - **Country Participation**: Which countries participate in the greatest variety of sports disciplines?
   - **Athlete Age**: How does the age of athletes affect their performance in boxing?
   - **Medal Distribution**: How does Olympic medal distribution vary among countries and genders?

4. **Data Visualizations**:
   - **Bar Charts** to show participation by country and the number of male and female athletes.
   - **Pie Charts** for medal type distribution across different countries.
   - **Scatter Plots** to analyze the impact of a swimmer's lane on their ranking.

### Technologies Used:
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards, data integration, and analysis.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for creating custom measures in Power BI.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation tasks.

## Project Deliverables:
- **Power BI File**: The `.pbix` file containing the dashboards and data transformations.
- **Integrated Dataset**: The new dataset after integrating and cleaning the data.
- **Research Insights Document**: A document with the answers to the research questions based on the analysis.

## How to Open and Run the Project:
1. **Open the Power BI Desktop** application on your computer.
2. **Open the Power BI File**: Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI.
3. **Interact with the Dashboards**: Use the slicers and explore the visualizations to answer the research questions.
4. **View the Research Questions**: Review the analysis, insights, and conclusions in the document provided.
